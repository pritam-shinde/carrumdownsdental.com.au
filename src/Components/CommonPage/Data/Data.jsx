The photos can then be displayed on a monitor where you can see and your dentist can discuss with you any areas of major concern and even suggest a variety of possible treatments depending on each individual dental problem. This allows for dental problems such as cavities and malocclusion to be carefully diagnosed and treated.`,

Magnification aids the dentist is checking for any hidden cracks or cavities that are just starting.
